    "# Introduction\n",
    " \n",
    "As is known, judges are elected in Texas. Judges being accountable, fair and impartial are very important for the public. It's reported that 2018 is the last year for [straight-ticket voting](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Judicial-elections-key-in-last-year-of-13327519.php) in Harris county and it is a year that [republican judges swept out by voters in Harris County election](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/GOP-Free-Zone-Republican-judges-swept-out-by-13376806.php). Ideally judges should be elected based on his/her merits. We will focus on investigating performance and accountability of judges in the data and address the issue of racial disparity and gender disparity from the following perspectives:\n",
    "* number of cases they heard \n",
    "* average length of court days after a case being filed and charge practices (shown in long version)\n",
    "* setting of bail amount broken down by defendants' race and gender \n",
    "* setting of sentence length broken down by defendants' race and gender\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# How is the number of court cases changing over time? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "TCJC ( Texas Criminal Justice Coalition) and January Advisors built [a dashboard](https://tcjcdashboard.org/) after assembling over a million criminal court dispositions throughout Texas to track dispositions in the Harris county court system. We want to explore the data from this dashboard. Here is the [data source](https://tcjcdashboard.org/data/) and [check this](https://www.hcdistrictclerk.com/Common/e-services/PublicDatasets.aspx) for data dictionary. Note that the cases are between 2010-01-01 and 2018-05-30 in Harris county. The data set is very diverse and there are lots of data features to be explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 34 types of offenses in the data, among which 'Assault - Nonsexual' takes the largest portion, followed by 'Theft', 'Alcohol - Driving', 'Controlled Substances - Other', 'Controlled Substances - Marijuana' etc. \n",
    "![png](img/output_36_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We display the trends of the top 5 categories by volume plus 'Prostitution' to get a clearer visualization. In the figure below, we consider cases filed before 2018.\n",
    "![png](img/output_10_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The monthly average number of court cases fluctuates over time. Good news is that all offense types in the data has a decreasing trend as shown in the figure. One possible reason is due to policy reforms. For instance, taking 'Marijuana' into account, [Jeff](https://www.januaryadvisors.com/low-level-marijuana-decline/) found that a policy reform on Marijuana in 2017 brings down the number significantly. Other possible reason could be that some records in process are not shown. And note that this is not [a crime trend visualization](https://github.com/phyhouhou/SpringboardProjects/blob/master/Crime%20Prediction%20for%20Houston/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Capstone_Project.ipynb). It is a visualization of defendant data for every criminal case disposed in Harris County since 2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Number of cases a judge hears every year\n",
    "We count how many cases each judge hears every year and show it below. It turned out that judges formed two groups: one group with less cases and one group with more cases with Judge Darrell Jordan being an exception. A natural question is to ask what are reasons for this division. One possibility might be that some of them do not work during some years between 2010 and 2018. I checked that except Darrell Jordan doesn't show up in 2011 in the data, all judges are present during this time span. Another possibility might be that judges with less cases only processing certain types of cases. However in the data there are records for each type of offenses under each judge's name. We need to dig other factors that distinguish judges in the two groups? Like the party that a judge is affiliated with, the number of years a judge is in office or which court that a judge is in charge of. We add those features 'judge_party' and 'judge_court' by extracting information from [here](http://www2.harriscountytx.gov/phonedirectory.aspx) and [here](http://www.ccl.hctx.net/criminal/7/default.htm). In the figure below, 'red' represents judges of republic party and 'blue' for democratic party. A majority of judges in the data is republican (28) with 10 being democratic. Obviously there is a branch with mixed colors, so party is not the factor to divide judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](img/output_9_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, '+' represents judges from district criminal court and circle represents judges from county criminal court. The criminal court is the key factor to distinguish judges. That's why judge Darrell Jordan even though heard less cases in his early years but soon fits into judges hearing more cases. Then the next question is whether judges are following the same standard in setting bail amount, sentencing and charge practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Average length of court_day and charge practice overview\n",
    "'court_day' is defined as the difference in days between 'fad' the date a case is filed and 'dispt' the date a case is disposed. Overall, there are two types of judges regarding the so-called 'court_day' depending on which court judges represent even though they might have some individual differences.\n",
    "![png](img/output_4_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show a figure to display the percentage of cases for which the 'curr_off' is different from 'com_off'. We count the number of such cases by giving it 1 if they are different and 0 if they are the same and then divide it by the total number of cases a judge heard. Obviously, there are still two groups. For different offense categories, the percentage of deviation might be larger or smaller from judges in one group than another.\n",
    "![png](img/output_5_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Focus on 'Prostituion'\n",
    "We decided to narrow down offense categories by focusing on 'Prostitution' and 'DUI' for investigation. In the following, we will first focus on 'Prostitution'. We will display the trend and performance of judges for this particular type of offense. The police is taking initiative of cracking down on prostitution and sex trafficking.\n",
    "[Recent news regarding prostitution](https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Massive-Houston-sex-sting-prostitution-bust-11942508.php) reported that:\n",
    "\"The motivation is to attempt to go higher in the chain [rather than target the prostitutes] - to get the traffickers themselves\". We'd like to know whether the action is taking effects that can be revealed by the data from the following perspectives:\n",
    "* How is the trend of prostitution case evolving over time?\n",
    "* Is 'bam' set fairly for female and male, black, white and Asian? \n",
    "* Is 'sentence' set fairly for female and male, black, white and Asian?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trend\n",
    "![png](img/output_16_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot on the trend shows that the number of prostitution cases fluctuates and was significantly dragged downwards by the action of arresting a large and increasing number of men indicated by shaded area. The efforts of police in cracking down on prostitution and sex trafficking by targeting higher in the chain works!\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the prostitution case, county criminal court judges heard much more cases than district criminal court except Darren Jordan. Below is plot on the 'court_day'. Length of red bar indicates deviation of average 'court_day' of female defendants of a judge from the overall average of females and length of blue bar likewise but for men defendants. Democratic judges' names are in blue. \n",
    "![png](img/output_27_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows that district criminal court judges while take less prostitution cases takes shorter 'court_day' than average except Darrell Jordan and Denise Bradley who need longer time for both women and men defendants while Nikita Harmon, Gorge Powell, Marc Carter, Robert Johnson, Denise Collins needs longer time for men defendant but much shorter time for women than average but Susan Brown and Vanessa Velasquez were the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, judges with more prostitution cases need longer time than average with Paula Goodhart, Don Smyth, Mike Fields and Jean Spradling being exceptions. And Dan Spjut, Paula Goodhart are faster in men defendant cases than women while Mike Fields was the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Are judges setting 'bam' fairly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are judges' trajectories in setting 'bam' going over time?**<br>\n",
    "We display difference of annual 'bam' median from its previous year for female. It shows that most of judges are stable in setting 'bam' for females except judge Catherin Evans, Pam Derbyshire, Mike Fields, Analia Wilkerson, Denise Bradley and Jim Wallace indicated by square symbols which display very large fluctuations. In case of male defendant, we find that most judges are not as stable as for females in setting 'bam' yet.\n",
    "![png](img/output_47_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the figure below to address the issue whether the judges have prejudice in setting 'bam' regarding 'def_sex'. \n",
    "![png](img/output_561_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that all district criminal court judges set much higher 'bam' than county criminal court judges regarding 'def_gender'. They set equal median 'bam' regardless gender of defendants. In contrast, county criminal court judges have bias in gender. Most of them set higher 'bam' for females except Analia Wilkerson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding 'def_race', all district criminal court judges set much higher 'bam' than county criminal court judges. They set equal median 'bam' for 'B' and 'W' but exhibit discrepancy in handling 'A' cases. In particular, judge Katherine Cabaniss, Catherine Evans,Jan Krocker and Denise Collins are setting extremely high 'bam' for 'A'.  In contrast, most of county criminal court judges have higher 'bam' for 'B' with Darrell Jordan being an exception. \n",
    "![png](img/output_581_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which judges’ bail amount is obviously deviating from the median?**\n",
    "When we try to compare the median ’bam’ of a judge broken down by ’def_sex’, we found that in general judges in the county criminal court have a lower 'bam' standard than district criminal court judges. Instead of comparing all judges together, we decide to focus on judges within subgroups to better distinguish judges. In particular, we focus on county criminal court judges since they show diversity more than district criminal court judges. Note that 'U' race is not shown in the figure to avoid distraction.\n",
    "![png](img/output_701_0.png)\n",
    "This figure clearly shows bias on 'def_rac' and 'def_sex' in setting 'bam' from country criminal court judges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Are judges setting 'sentence' fairly?\n",
    "I will not consider probation here, instead I will focus on cases disposed with jail. We find that most judges are stable in setting 'sentence' in their trajactory except Judge Jim Wallace in his early years.\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](img/output_63_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding sentence length, judges in the county criminal court set shorter sentence in general. And in this group, most of judges set either higher if not equal 'bam' for females than males with Judge Darrell Jordan being an exception. \n",
    "![png](img/output_831_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of races, district criminal court judges set longer jail length than county judges. In the former group, judges set higher if not equal jail length for 'W' than 'B' while in the latter group it's the opposite. Judge Jan Jan Krocker and Denise Bradley set longer jail for 'A'.\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](img/output_851_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Focus on DUI\n",
    "\n",
    "DUI is a problem that impacts people of all ages and walks of life. Here is some [statistics](https://www.rightstep.com/resources/texas-addiction-information/texas-drunk-driving-statistics/). According to Texas law, being intoxicated while driving means having a blood-alcohol level (BAC) of 0.08 or higher. \n",
    "A typical drinker can achieve that level of drunkenness from having two or three drinks in an hour. For women and adolescents, drinking just one or two drinks in an hour may lead to a BAC of 0.08.\n",
    "([anti-DUI effort](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/transportation/2018/08/22/301235/authorities-try-a-new-approach-to-combat-houstons-high-rate-of-drunk-driving/))\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted similar research on DUI cases. We find that there are more male defendants charged under DUI than females. A decreasing trend shows up for both. And the decrease in male cases is more drastic than females.\n",
    "Concerning charge practices, judges in county criminal court have a lower portion of change than those in district criminal court in which judge Randy Roll has the lowest portion in change of charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Are men and women punished fairly?\n",
    "We find that median of 'bam' higher than in the group of district criminal court judges (in which most judges set 'bam' equally for men and women except George Powell, Jan Krocker, Vanessa Velasquez, Katherine Cabaniss) than that in county criminal court judges (in which most judges set higher 'bam'for men except Darrell Jordan, Bill Harmon, Dan Spjut, Margaret Harris setting equally regardless of gender). \n",
    "\n",
    "![png](img/output_115_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding jail length, all district court judges set longer sentence for male than females and most county judges was the opposite, i.e., longer sentence for females than males with Bill Harmon(male longer than female), Larry Standley(equal), Mike Fields(equal) being exceptions.\n",
    "![png](img/output_117_0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also find that most judges are stable in setting jail length in their trajectory except judge Susan Brown and Nikita Harmon who have a larger fluctuation in recent years in setting jail length for females. Concerning setting 'bam', judges Mike Field, Randy Roll and Catherin Evans fluctuates a lot more than others for both male and female defendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Are defendants of different races punished fairly?\n",
    "District criminal court judges are more fair than county judges with some judges being exceptions as shown in the figures below.\n",
